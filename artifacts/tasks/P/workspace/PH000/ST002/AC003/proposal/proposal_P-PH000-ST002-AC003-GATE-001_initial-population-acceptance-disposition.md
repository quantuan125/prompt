# PROPOSAL: Gate Disposition Package — GATE-001 Initial Population Acceptance (P-PH000-ST002-AC003)

## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

- **Context**: GATE-001 is the implementation-backed acceptance gate for AC003 (Backfill & Validate Initial Program Entries). AC003 populated the first governed program-status baseline for `P`, `T102`, and `T104` at activity-level granularity, derived the initial narrative, and packaged developer evidence plus reviewer verification for Client disposition.
- **Goal at gate**: Obtain Client acceptance of the initial populated status-system baseline, confirming that the ledger, narrative, and evidence package are sufficiently accurate and traceable to serve as the first operational program-status snapshot.
- **Scope**: TK001-TK006 produced the populated ledger, derived narrative, and DEV-REPORT. TK007 produced a same-gate verification cycle that initially returned `RECYCLE`, then passed after bounded dependency-ID remediation. TK008 packages the final gate-readiness set and records the pending GDR for Client decision.

## III. DISPOSITION SUMMARY REGISTER

This gate has no GIR (Gate Information Request) items requiring decision disposition. GATE-001 is an implementation acceptance gate for the populated baseline, not a design-decision gate. Client disposition at this gate is based on implementation evidence, verification outcome, and package traceability.

| GIR ID | Gap/Topic | Decision Area | Recommended Option | Execution Target | Blocking | Client Decision |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| — | No design-decision items at this gate | — | — | — | — | — |

---

## IV. DETAILED DISPOSITION REGISTER

No GIR items exist for this gate. The detailed disposition register defers to the verification artifact for implementation conformance evidence.

**Verification summary** (from `verification_P-PH000-ST002-AC003_gate-001.md`):
- Initial review (`v1.0.0`): `RECYCLE` due to malformed dependency `from_id` values and inaccurate DEV-REPORT validation claims.
- Same-gate reassessment (`v2.0.0`): all reviewer checks pass after bounded developer remediation.
- Final reviewer verdict: **PASS**

---

## V. CONSULTANT GATE RECOMMENDATION

Consultant recommendation:
- `APPROVE`

Reviewer verdict alignment (implementation-backed gate):
- Reviewer verdict: `PASS`
- Verification artifact: `prompt/artifacts/tasks/P/workspace/PH000/ST002/AC003/verification/verification_P-PH000-ST002-AC003_gate-001.md`
- Alignment: `Aligned` — The consultant recommendation of APPROVE is consistent with the reviewer’s final PASS verdict. The same-gate recycle loop was completed before proposal assembly, the blocking finding was resolved in reassessment, and no active findings remain.

Conditions and/or deferrals:
- —

Downstream enforcement:
- AC003 closes only when the Client records a decision in the GDR below.
- AC004 planning/execution may treat the populated AC003 baseline as accepted only after this GATE-001 GDR records `APPROVE` or `APPROVE WITH CONDITIONS`.

## VI. GATE DECISION RECORD (GDR)

## Gate Decision Record

| Field | Value |
|:--|:--|
| Gate ID | `P-PH000-ST002-AC003-GATE-001` |
| Consultant Recommendation | `APPROVE` |
| Client Decision | `pending` |
| Gate Status After Decision | `pending` |
| Conditions (if any) | — |
| Decided By | `Client` |
| Decision Date | `pending` |
| Decision Reference | `pending` |

The `Consultant Recommendation` is populated at authoring time. It synthesizes the final reviewer verdict and the completed same-gate recycle loop. The reviewer verdict remains only in the verification artifact.
